 The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. <br>In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. <br>Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound.<br> There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. <br> Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll.<br> Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.<br>
